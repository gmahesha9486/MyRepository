Cloud Foundry is a container-based platform. 

BOSH, a tool used to run Cloud Foundry itself.

BOSH takes care of the entire lifecycle required to run Cloud Foundry
For BOSH, this method is called a manifest file


Another benefit of lifecycle management is how BOSH deploys an agent on each part of the system, 
so that if one piece fails, it can quickly alert operators and even automatically repair the problem. 
An operator is usually known in the BOSH community as someone who writes and manages various releases that have been built with BOSH.
